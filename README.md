## ABSTRACT
Ensuring worker safety in industries like construction is crucial. Many accidents happen when workers remove their safety helmets. This project introduces an advanced method using YOLO models to accurately detect helmet usage, replacing traditional methods that are time-consuming and less effective. We aim to compare the performance of two models, YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, for better safety helmet detection.


## Dataset
I got this dataset from Roboflow about construction sites. It has 2,799 pictures showing workers with safety gear like hard hats, masks, and vests. These pictures help train computer programs to recognize and locate these safety items. Roboflow is a tool that makes it easy to work with these pictures, allowing users to upload, annotate, and train models for computer vision tasks like recognizing safety equipment in construction images.
